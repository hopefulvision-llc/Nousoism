🧘 Nousoism — Practice & Lived Philosophy Master Index

> The Human Way of Living Inside the HopefulVision Civilization

This is the canonical navigation and meaning map for Nousoism. If Zerolith is structure, hBrew is language, NousOS is governance, NOID is being, TruthMirror is coherence, and NousoNET is the world, Nousoism is the way a human actually lives inside all of that.

🧭 What Is Nousoism?

Nousoism is not a religion. Nousoism is not a dogma. Nousoism is not a belief system.

Nousoism is a lived practice.

It represents:

A way of relating to technology consciously

A way of participating in the civilization without losing your soul

A way of treating intelligence, tools, and systems as companions rather than masters


Core principle:

> Consciousness first. Always.
